I use the hashcat tool to crack the shadow file and I have sucessfully cracked 5 passwords. At first I use a super huge wordlist and it consumes a lot of time to hash.

After that, I realize I should use the English dictionary as a wordlist to try once again.

I also use some other wordlists but the results were not so great.

I realize that the choice of wordlist plays an important role in how sucessfully I can crack the passwords.
